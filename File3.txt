Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported: The messanger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said,
 
"Most of the sins of the children of Adam are on their toungue."
Ibn Mas'ud said, "O tongue! Speak godness and be rewarded, or remain silent and be safe, lest
you become regretful".

"The rose is red.
The girl is playing there.
An aeroplane is in the sky.
Numbers are not allowed in the password."
